===========

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

* For more information on the data set read the file "UCI HAR Dataset\README.txt" and the project site http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
* To generate the processed data file use the run_analysis.R script.
* Read the file CodeBook.md for information about the steps used to process the data and the contents of each variable inside the R script.
* the R script has several comments so reading the script should be easy.
* The main outcome of this script is a file called "course_project_q1.txt", which has the average of each variable for each activity and subject.

This is the Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera.
